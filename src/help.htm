<h1><img src="lemma48.gif"/>LeMMA - a GUI frontend for creating MMA files</h1>
<p>Created by Gek S. Low. Released under the GPL.</p>
<p>
Note that this is NOT really an MMA editor, but rather a simple front-end to generate simple MMA files. I wrote this program so that I can churn out and play chord progressions easily.
</p>
<h2>BEFORE YOU START</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
If you just installed a new version of LeMMA and it exits immediately, you may need to delete settings.dat and grooves.dat because of changes in the file formats.
</li>
<li>
Please click on "Settings" to set up the right paths. You may want to refresh the grooves library in "Settings" which will read the groove information in your MMA installation.
</li>
<li>
Custom groove library is optional and is for advanced users who have set up their own grooves in another location. It uses the SetLibPath and SetAutoLibPath directives. Please refer to MMA documentation. Note that this feature is still fairly experimental.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
You can supply a filename to LeMMA and it will try to open the file.
</li>
<li>
If you are having problems, start LeMMA at the console with the '--debug' option.
</li>
<li>
Just type your chords in the measure boxes (e.g. 'C / F /'. You are currently limited to up to 80 measures.
</li>
<li>
For repeats, click on the barlines to toggle to the various types.
</li>
<li>
Type '[1', '[2', etc in the measure boxes for repeat endings 1, 2, etc (the numbers don't matter actually)
</li>
<li>
Please note that the first empty measure is regarded as the end of the song. All following measures will be ignored!
</li>
<li>
To have a measure continue the last chord in the previous measure, enter '/'
</li>
<li>
LeMMA doesn't interpret the chords/contents in the measures in any way. Enter garbage and you'll get garbage. :-)
</li>
<li>
You can set the groove for a measure by clicking on '(Groove)' above the measure.
</li>
<li>
Advanced users can click on 'Code' to insert MMA commands for each measure. The commands are inserted between the Groove command and the measure definition. Use 'View MMA' to preview the generated codes.
</li>
<li>
You can load and save MMA files, but note that this is meant for files generated by LeMMA. <i>If you save/load a carefully handcrafted MMA file you probably WILL lose information in the process.</i>
</li>
</ol>
